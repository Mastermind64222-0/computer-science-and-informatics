# computer-science-and-informatics
I have chosen to optionaly take on the role of being a life student (I do not wish to ever stop learning until my last memory) in my own capacity. Over the years, backtracking way back to my childhood, growing up, high school and all the way upto university, I have had the opportunity accept or decline life experiences in both my academics and non-academic arena. With what I have learnt and continue to learn from the day I was born to this very moment in life, it is my responsibility to share, guide &amp; assist my fellow learners to the best of my abilities. The purpose of this repo is to provide an organized and up-to-date list of resources related to Computer Science, Informatics and any other resource which I feel can be useful to those who will be making use of it. Also, something to note is that, I will very much be welcoming suggestions and any constructive criticism. I will also welcome anyone who also feels the need to contribute to this, I will gladly welcome them and appreciate their efforts as well.
